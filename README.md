# Overview

SQLiteChangesetSync is a Swift package that enables the synchronization of SQLite databases across multiple devices by leveraging the [SQLite Session Extension](https://www.sqlite.org/sessionintro.html). It primarily focuses on an offline-first approach, allowing changes to be captured as binary data blobs in a `changeset` table within the SQLite database. After being committed, these changesets can be pushed to, and fetched from a remote repository, and then merged into local databases. This functionality mirrors key actions of git, adapting them to the context of database synchronization. The package is designed for scenarios requiring consistent data across different instances, particularly useful in environments with intermittent network connectivity.
